jcreate
=======

A Java library that allows you to control an iRobot Create robot platform.

This project provides Java programmers a simple interface to make an iRobot Create "go" using the iRobot Open Interface specification. It depends on the RXTX library for serial communication. This library does NOT implement the whole Open Interface specification. Its primary goal is to allow for quick startup of and easy access to the iRobot Create. Some features are not currently implemented, such as the scripting commands.

This library also serves an educational example of how the Java Concurrency tools can be used to get interesting work done. Furthermore, you can see how to handle serial port communication in a high level language.
